## Introduction

This website first only meant to be a Single Page Minialistic Portfolio Website. But then I decided to add other features as well. I used NextJS for the website, TailwindCSS for styling, and Typescript for writing the code. The website is responsive and works on all devices. This was my first project using NextJs
and I really enjoyed working with it. I am Still haved finished the website, due to some reasons I had to stop working on it.
